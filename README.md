# Simple Todo App

This application is a ToDo list that displays any events that you are planning for the day, week, month, or year! It's simple to use and easy to navigate.

## Functionality

This project displays a ToDo list that adds new ToDo events after clicking on the add ToDo button. Once a modal appears, you are able to name the ToDo as you like and set the date for the ToDo event and submit it to the list already displayed. If you would like to delete all the current ToDo events, you may click on the delete button to remove the event and have only your new event displayed. The list also displayes a checkbox for each event listed that may be clicked for a completed state or unchecked for a non-completed state.

## Technology

In this project we use HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make it all come together. For example in the HTML we have a script tag that connects our JavaScript files to the webpage. In the JavaScript files we've refactored the code for easier accesibility with different files that pertain to a certain element used in the application. The simpler it is for a software engineer to read the better!
